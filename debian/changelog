base-files (7.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * The change introduced in version 7.7 regarding /mnt seems to break
    the ability of debootstrap currently in wheezy to create a sid chroot.
    The case of initial install of /mnt is already handled by postinst line
    "install_directory mnt 755 root" inside the big "if" block that
    creates a bunch of other things, so we can restrict re-creating the /mnt
    directory on upgrades to the case when we are really upgrading.
    Therefore, the code is moved to the same "if" block where /etc/profile
    and /etc/nsswitch.conf are upgraded to their new defaults when unchanged.
    This might help as a workaround for Bug#766459.

    every point release, using Debian 8.x as an example, to be read by
    users of jessie during its lifetime as stable. Closes: #621757.
  * Changed default /etc/profile to source /etc/bash.bashrc after
    processing profile.d stuff, not before. Closes: #698479.
  * Drop comment lines about umask in /etc/profile, as it has been
    there for enough time for everybody to take note.
  * The directory /mnt is not included inside base-files.deb anymore.
    Instead, it is created by postinst the very first time base-files
    is installed (by debootstrap), or when upgrading from an earlier
    base-files version. This should make the usual upgrade at every point
    release to work even if /mnt is a stale mount point. Closes: #763405.

  * By default, when the computer is booting, green and red colors are used

    upgrade (instead of waiting for the next point release). Closes: #689835.
    Drop "unmodified" word in postinst, as it may not always be true.
  * Dropped versioned Breaks on sendfile, as it had no effect.
  * Changed debian_version, issue, issue.net and os-release to read "7.0".
    Added also "(wheezy)" in VERSION and PRETTY_NAME.
  * Added VERSION and VERSION_ID to /etc/os-release, for release as stable.
    Please remember: Applications should not rely on these fields to be set.
  * Updated README (wheezy -> jessie).

base-files (6.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added HOME_URL, SUPPORT_URL and BUG_REPORT_URL to /etc/os-release.
    Reported by Raphaël Hertzog. Closes: #681480.
  * Added Breaks: sendfile (<< version in squeeze) to help sendfile bug
    regarding improper modification of /etc/profile to be fixed faster.

base-files (6.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Create /etc/motd instead of /etc/motd.tail, with same default contents,
    as initscripts is now using /etc/motd again as a real file.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Jun 2012 14:14:44 +0200

base-files (6.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Record md5sums of unmodified /etc/profile versions so that we can
    upgrade it automatically, as it's done in Ubuntu.
  * In the initial install, create /etc/motd.tail instead of /etc/motd,
    as /etc/motd is converted to a symlink by initscripts and /etc/motd.tail
    is since a long time the master copy to which the output of uname is added.
    Remove postinst code which tries to update /etc/motd, as it does no longer
    work and the file has not changed in a lot of time. Will add code to
    update /etc/motd.tail based on md5sum if it ever changes in a future.
  * Implement proposed transition plan for group staff in /usr/local.
    The file /etc/staff-group-for-usr-local is now created on upgrades
    from releases before 6.10 and (for now) also on initial install.
  * Removed reference to /etc/nsswitch.conf in extended description, as
    the file is being moved to libc-bin.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 09 Jun 2012 17:41:30 +0200

base-files (6.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * We can't make /etc/profile a conffile without triggering a piuparts
    check which is considered to be serious. Sorry, /etc/profile
    will be handled as before for now. Closes: #673767.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon, 21 May 2012 15:12:06 +0200

base-files (6.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /etc/os-release. Closes: #659853. Note: for stable releases
    this file will look like it's suggested in the bug report above.
    Also, like /etc/debian_version, this file should only be considered
    meaningful for stable releases, which testing and unstable are not.
  * By popular demand, make /etc/profile a conffile. Closes: #668871.
  * Added /sys for all systems but the Hurd. Closes: #670091.
  * Added /proc for the Hurd, as it's already being used.
  * Added a lintian override for /root being 700.

base-files (6.7) unstable; urgency=low

    obsolete and it should not go away. Closes: #651356.

base-files (6.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch to "files" instead of "compat" in default /etc/nsswitch.conf.
    That was only useful for libc5. The new default will only take
    effect for new installs. Thanks to Roger Leigh. Closes: #651356.
  * Reword the very first question in base-files FAQ. Closes: #622200.
  * When migrating /var/run and /var/lock, create relative symlinks
    instead of absolute ones. Useful for chroots. Closes: #652301.

base-files (6.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /run. Closes: #620157.
  * On new installs:
    - Create /run/lock (debian-installer will remove it but this will
    ensure that it exists even on chroot environments).
    - Symlink /var/run to /run.
    - Symlink /var/lock to /run/lock.
  * On upgraded systems, initscripts will handle the transition to /run.
  * Added "Breaks: initscripts << (2.88dsf-13.3)" to ensure that initscripts
    is upgraded first, as otherwise udev would break.
  * Thanks a lot to Roger Leigh.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Fri, 27 May 2011 14:25:42 +0200

base-files (6.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Dropped /run until everything else is ready for it. In particular,
    udev should not blindly assume that it works just because it exists.

base-files (6.2) unstable; urgency=low

base-files (5.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Changed postinst to not reset /var/run/utmp permissions on every upgrade.
    It is definitely not base-files business to change the permissions of
    an already existing /var/run/utmp, as the system admin might have
    changed them on purpose after the file was created. Closes: #601746.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Nov 2010 13:01:12 +0100

base-files (5.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Changed /etc/profile so that it defines PATH again. Closes: #571086.
    We will have plenty of time to discuss about this after the release
    of squeeze, but for now, this is the safe thing to do.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Fri, 06 Aug 2010 19:37:40 +0200

base-files (5.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added GPL version 1 from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/Licenses/ as there
    are a lot of packages still using it. Bug #436105.

base-files (5.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ordinary user accounts start at UID 1000 by default, but they also
    end at 29999 by default. Modified default /etc/profile accordingly.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Thu, 20 May 2010 11:34:34 +0200

base-files (5.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed default /etc/profile so that the new umask of 002 is only
    used for ordinary user accounts, which, according to policy, start
    at uid 1000 by default.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 19 May 2010 18:57:10 +0200

base-files (5.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed umask in default /etc/profile to 002, which has a little bit
    more sense than 022 on systems like Debian having User Private Groups.
    As usual for /etc/profile, only new installs will have the new default,
    so nobody will be surprised by this on upgrades. Hopefully, this change
    will be documented in the release notes for squeeze as well, for users
    who install squeeze from scratch. Closes: #248140, #581434.
  * Refresh GNU licenses from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/Licenses/, as they
    have expanded the embedded tabs. Closes: #572245.
  * Switch to "3.0 (native)" format.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Thu, 13 May 2010 18:35:42 +0200

base-files (5.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed default /etc/profile so that it sources /etc/profile.d/*.sh
    as mandated by the LSB section 16.2. Closes: #545756.
    Package maintainers: Please don't use profile.d if you can avoid it,
    as policy says "A program must not depend on environment variables
    to get reasonable defaults".
  * Removed questions about profile.d from FAQ.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Fri, 09 Apr 2010 18:07:20 +0200

base-files (5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added question in FAQ to document the fact that some configuration
    files in /etc are never updated on upgrades. Closes: #571083.
  * Changed default /usr/src to be root:root and 755. Closes: #573701.
    The old permissions were of little benefit, and the user can still
    change this after installing a new system anyway.
  * Renamed FAQ to README and added a compatibility symlink.
  * Removed obsolete Depends on base-passwd, as version 2.0.3.4 is more
    than 10 years old and we don't support upgrades which skip releases.
  * Dropped preinst completely, as it was there just to support upgrades
    from very old releases (that we don't support anymore).
  * Removed postinst code that supports upgrades from very old releases.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 04 Apr 2010 13:22:04 +0200

base-files (5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed default permissions for /root to 700, as many admins consider
    it should be more private than other home directories. Closes: #514794.
  * Changed default permissions for /var/log/btmp to 660, to be in sync
    with permissions set by logrotate. Closes: #547407.
  * Do not export PS1 in /root/.bashrc, as it has bash escapes and it's
    inherited to subshells that do not have to be bash. Closes: #567733.
  * Added debian_chroot variable to default PS1 in /root/.bashrc.
  * Comment out PS1 in /root/.bashrc anyway, as /etc/profile and
    /etc/bash.bashrc already care about it. Closes: #443245.
  * Comment out umask as well, as it's already in /etc/profile.
  * Added /usr/local/games to default PATH in /etc/profile. Closes: #487105.
  * While we are at it, comment out everything about PATH, as /etc/login.defs
    should already care about this.
  * Changed default /etc/profile so that it sources /etc/bash.bashrc
    if the shell is bash. Closes: #275622.
  * Drop \u part from default PS1 in /etc/profile, as it's only useful
    for people with several non-root accounts. Most people are either root
    or an ordinary user, so $ and # are enough to differentiate between them.
  * Comment out PS1 setting in /etc/profile anyway, as we have bash.bashrc.

base-files (5.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop README.base, remove-base, and the lines in postinst which checked
    for the old base package being present.
  * Do not fiddle with /etc/adjtime anymore, as it does not belong here.
  * Added file /etc/dpkg/origins/debian from dpkg package, for the benefit
    of Debian-derived distributions, as base-files is trivial to fork.
    Hopefully, this will be one less reason to fork dpkg. Closes: #487437.
  * Added dpkg (<= 1.15.0) to Replaces, because of the above.
  * On initial install and also on upgrades, create /etc/dpkg/origins/default
    as a symlink to /etc/dpkg/origins/debian, if it does not exist.
  * Updated copyright year in copyright file.

  * Changed issue, issue.net and debian_version to read "squeeze/sid".
  * Added GFDL-1.3 from http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.txt as new
    packages in unstable are starting to use it. Closes: #517196.
  * Updated generic GFDL symlink accordingly, as it is always supposed

base-files (4.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the way wtmp, btmp and lastlog are handled. They are no longer
    recreated at every base-files upgrade. Instead, they are only created
    once, when base-files is installed by debootstrap. It is really not
    base-files business to fiddle with those files, as it is documented
    that removing them is the standard way to disable logging to them.
    Closes: #488376.

base-files (4.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed awk from Depends to Pre-Depends. Closes: #314571, #469552.
    This is required to make the awk virtual package to be truly essential,
    as only essential packages, their predependencies, and the dependencies
    of their predependencies are guaranteed to be "working at all times".
    Previously, the packaging system was allowed to remove an awk flavour
    and install another one in the middle of an upgrade, which may break
    packages using awk in their preinsts (and in fact, it happened).
    Tkanks a lot to Steve Langasek for clarifying this issue.
  * It's still soon to change /etc/debian_version. Please be patient.

    become common licenses. Closes: #431176. Please note that GPL and LGPL
    will now point to GPL-3 and LGPL-3, as they are the most recent ones.
    Packages under GPLv2 without "or any later version" must definitely
    refer to the versioned file, not to the GPL symlink anymore.

    [ As usual, please note that this will only affect new installs ].
    This directory is also allowed to be a symlink to /etc/local, but that's

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 24 Mar 2004 13:40:46 +0100

base-files (3.0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /srv, /media and /usr/local/share/man (Closes: #230909).
  * Added /usr/local/man as a symlink to /usr/local/share/man,
    since FHS says both directories should be "synonymous".
  * I'm not populating /media because subdirectories are optional.
    They only must exist "if the corresponding subsystem is installed".
    Detecting such things is not really base-files business. I would
    expect debian-installer to create those subdirectories instead.
  * /cdrom and /floppy will still be created in the first install until
    debian-installer and/or apt stop using them for new installs.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Feb 2004 17:47:34 +0100

base-files (3.0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made issue and issue.net generated files, to prevent a double "GNU/"
    prefix on GNU/K*BSD systems (Closes: #217383).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Oct 2003 21:38:44 +0100

base-files (3.0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated /etc/inputrc (from readline maintainer). Closes: #213666.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Thu,  2 Oct 2003 16:42:58 +0200

base-files (3.0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use `:' for chown, not `.' (Closes: #204860).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Aug 2003 00:42:22 +0200

base-files (3.0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Prevent OSNAME from having the GNU/ prefix twice (Closes: #200741).
  * Updated LGPL-2.1 from ftp.gnu.org. Instead of form feeds, the old
    version was using `^' followed by `L' (Closes: #201867).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Jul 2003 19:25:12 +0200

base-files (3.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the way /etc/motd is updated so that it still works when md5sum
    prints a `-' after the md5sum value (Closes: #180920).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Feb 2003 14:30:04 +0100

base-files (3.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "Why isn't license `foo' included in common-licenses?" to the FAQ.
    Thanks to Colin Watson for the suggestion.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Jan 2003 20:32:16 +0100

base-files (3.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed /etc/profile so that PS1 isn't set for non-interactive shells.
    This should make the usual way of testing for interactive shells
    (checking for PS1) to always work (Closes: #164846).
  * Changed /etc/motd to better reflect the truth about Debian: s/Most of//
    and s/freely redistributable/free software/ (Closes: #169543).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Nov 2002 22:06:12 +0100

base-files (3.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a small FAQ. The current topics are:
  - Why Debian does not have a profile.d directory?
  - I upgraded to testing, why /etc/issue does not read "testing"?
  * Standards-Version: 3.5.7 (do not create or remove doc symlinks).
    Note: In theory, packages still creating doc symlinks are allowed
    to blindly assume /usr/doc exists, so /usr/doc will still be part of
    base-files for some time.
  * Removed prerm, since it's not required anymore.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Oct 2002 15:21:52 +0200

base-files (3.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * /etc/profile does no longer export PS1. This should prevent
    strange prompts to be shown when switching from bash to a shell which
    does not understand bash escapes (Closes: #141193).
  * Set distribution to "testing/unstable".

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Jul 2002 16:01:02 +0200

base-files (3.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed wrong group ownerships under GNU/Hurd. This may also happen under
    Linux when using the `bsdgroups' mount option, but even in this case
    it will not happen if the package is built using fakeroot.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Apr 2002 14:18:44 +0200

base-files (3.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Made /usr/share/doc/base-files/remove-base more robust (Closes: #132969).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Feb 2002 16:36:54 +0100

base-files (3.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Modified postinst to use awk only on upgrades, not in the first install.
    This should help debootstrap (Closes: #130056, #130087).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Jan 2002 14:52:34 +0100

base-files (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Restored /usr/doc since it's still required by the system according
    to the doc transition plan.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Jan 2002 13:18:12 +0100

base-files (3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Changed issue, issue.net and debian_version to read "3.0".

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Nov 2001 11:22:42 +0100

base-files (2.2.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed /usr/doc.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Nov 2001 13:23:32 +0100

base-files (2.2.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Created /opt, /etc/opt and /var/opt in the first install.
    They are mentioned in FHS 2.1 and required in FHS 2.2 (Closes: #118505).
  * The copyright file now refers to GNU/Linux or GNU/Hurd as appropriate.
  * Updated README.base and postinst to refer to /usr/share/doc.
  * Updated default /etc/adjtime to current millenium.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Nov 2001 17:02:50 +0100

base-files (2.2.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * GPL is now a symlink to GPL-2, which is the real file.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun,  2 Sep 2001 13:26:34 +0200

base-files (2.2.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * s/info readline/info rluserman/ in /etc/inputrc (Closes: #109110).
  * Updated LGPL-2.1 from ftp.gnu.org to fix line breaks (Closes: #109319).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Aug 2001 17:29:10 +0200

base-files (2.2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the first install, populate /usr/local even if it exists.
    Allows /usr/local to be mounted in a separate partition during the
    install process (Closes: #107662).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Aug 2001 19:09:16 +0200

base-files (2.2.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed /var/state and /var/state/misc, added /usr/local/games.
    Reported by Sebastian Riedel.
  * Made /boot mode 755 and owned by root group, since no part of the system
    seems to require special permissions here (Closes: #102080).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Jun 2001 19:45:46 +0200

base-files (2.2.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Creates /etc/motd in the initial install (now made by debootstrap).
    Forgot to do this in 2.2.7. Reported by Matt Kraai (Closes: #101342).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Jun 2001 14:38:33 +0200

base-files (2.2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made /etc/debian_version a `conffile' (Closes: #81249). To prevent
    unneeded dpkg prompting, this file is overwritten in the preinst
    if upgrading from a base-files release previous to 2.2.6
    (thanks to Joey Hess for suggesting this solution).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Mar 2001 19:33:22 +0100

base-files (2.2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * The file /etc/motd is no longer a conffile. Instead, it will be updated
    if its md5sum (minus its first two lines) matches the one in a list of
    md5sums of previous Debian releases. This will reduce dpkg prompting
    on upgrades (Closes: #71083).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Mar 2001 20:23:06 +0100

base-files (2.2.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use "testing/unstable" instead of "2.2" for the distribution number.
    It seems everybody prefers to see something else other than "2.2".

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Dec 2000 11:41:55 +0100

base-files (2.2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified debian_version, issue and issue.net in /etc so that they
    read "2.2" again, since this is the last Debian *stable* release so far.
    Since packages in `unstable' are now automatically moved to `testing',
    a codename in /etc/debian_version will never be "right" for everybody, so
    the only sensible thing to do here is to wait until a new release number
    has been officially decided (Closes: #80784).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Dec 2000 20:40:05 +0100

base-files (2.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored LGPL -> LGPL-2.1 symlink, which was mistakenly removed
    in base-files_2.2.1 (Bug #75949).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Nov 2000 11:21:54 +0100

base-files (2.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /var/lib/misc, since it's required by FHS (Closes: Bug #74317).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Oct 2000 20:09:48 +0200

base-files (2.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reduced verbosity, as suggested by Sean Perry (Closes: #70686).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Sep 2000 14:05:12 +0200

base-files (2.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release for woody (debian_version, issue and issue.net).
  * /etc/motd now refers to /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.
  * Removed /usr/doc/copyright and /usr/man.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Jul 2000 13:20:17 +0200

base-files (2.2.0) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * The recipe in README.base does not work properly because dpkg
    removes the conffiles listed in the status file (Bug #64734).
    So, getting rid of base involves editing the status file.
    To avoid mistakes, a shell script is now provided for that.
    Thanks to Kevin Dalley <kevind@alacosta.org> for the report.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Sat, 27 May 2000 20:27:13 +0200

base-files (2.2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * preinst and postinst: Do not deal with /dev/pts anymore.
  * issue and issue.net: Removed the `frozen' word.
  * Final release for potato (hopefully).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon, 24 Apr 2000 14:02:44 +0200

base-files (2.1.20) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Made /var/log mode 755 and root.root (Bug #35504).
  * Made /cdrom and /floppy mode 755 and root.root (Bug #25847).
  * Removed /dev/pts. It made the package impossible to upgrade when
    using devfs with Linux 2.4. libc6 is already supposed to deal
    with /dev/pts (Bug #61408).
  * postinst removes base.conffiles as well (otherwise, some files
    like /etc/motd or /root/.bash_profile may disappear).
    Thanks a lot to Mikko Oilinki for the report.
  * Slightly improved README.base.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue,  4 Apr 2000 17:31:01 +0200

base-files (2.1.19) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed /usr/dict (Bug #60118).
  * Minimal handling of the old base package (Bug #32888).
  * Removed redundant directive in /etc/inputrc (Bug #59689).
  * Do not reference /usr/share/doc in /etc/motd yet (Bug #61116).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue, 28 Mar 2000 17:51:46 +0200

base-files (2.1.18) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle better the /var/spool/mail-being-a-symlink case.
  * Added /dev/pts for UNIX98-style pty handling under Linux.
  * Added a README.FHS.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon,  7 Feb 2000 18:29:00 +0100

base-files (2.1.17) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Some people has /var/spool/mail symlinked to somewhere else.
    For this case, preinst now saves the symlink target before dpkg
    removes it and postinst restores it.
  * Do not fiddle with /usr/local on upgrades. From now on, users
    will be free to remove it if they wish.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Sat,  5 Feb 2000 20:10:17 +0100

base-files (2.1.16) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Generate default info dir file from /usr/share/base-files/info.dir.
  * Do not generate an info dir file if one exists at /usr/share/info.
  * Updated LGPL version 2 from ftp.gnu.org to fix a typo.
  * Mail spool is /var/mail as per FHS (only in new installs).
  * Acknowledge in the copyright file that the GNU Public Licenses are
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Fri,  4 Feb 2000 14:26:21 +0100

base-files (2.1.15) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed misleading copyright notice in /etc/motd.
  * Distribution set to "2.2" (adding `frozen' in issue and issue.net).
  * Use DEB_HOST_GNU_SYSTEM for the architecture stuff wherever possible.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Fri, 28 Jan 2000 14:03:25 +0100

base-files (2.1.14) unstable; urgency=high

  * Swap binary-arch and binary-indep targets in debian/rules, since this
    is now Architecture: any. Thanks to Roman Hodek for the report.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Wed, 22 Dec 1999 19:48:24 +0100

base-files (2.1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made "Architecture: any" for /etc/motd to be os-dependant.
    [ A binary-all-<os> scheme would simplify this ].
  * Exclude /proc from the .deb under GNU/Hurd (reported by Marcus Brinkmann).
  * Added `set -e' to postinst.
  * Standards-Version: 3.1.1 (doc symlinks).
  * Removed obsolete README. If someone still asks about /usr/spool or
    /var/adm then a paragraph could be added to the Debian FAQ.
  * Follow changes suggested by Branden Robinson:
  * Removed remaining bashisms in default /root/.profile and use
    /usr/bin/X11 for X11 binaries.
  * Improved package description.
  * Removed unused bin/edit in the source.
  * Changed root test in /etc/profile to use id -u.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue, 21 Dec 1999 11:53:35 +0100

base-files (2.1.12) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed Replaces field (reported a zillion times).
  * Updated /etc/profile to use '$ ' as the shell prompt for normal
    users and '# ' for the superuser if $BASH is not set.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon, 20 Dec 1999 12:56:18 +0100

base-files (2.1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include /etc/inputrc and /etc/profile from readline and bash,

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Fri, 17 Dec 1999 14:36:23 +0100

base-files (2.1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create /var/log/lastlog as root.utmp, mode 664.
  * Removed Linuxisms from /etc/motd.
  * Updated GPL from ftp.gnu.org to be Y2K-compliant.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue, 21 Sep 1999 12:18:57 +0200

base-files (2.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the advertising clause from BSD license (Bug #43347).
    Reason: ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change
    Thanks to J.H.M. Dassen for the report.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Thu, 26 Aug 1999 14:04:51 +0200

base-files (2.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added base-passwd (>= 2.0.3.4) to the Depends field.
  * utmp and wtmp are now root.utmp and mode 664 (Bug #41569).
  * Updated extended description regarding the common licenses.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue, 27 Jul 1999 14:03:23 +0200

base-files (2.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * LGPL is now the Lesser Gnu Public License (Bug #40759).
    For now, the old version is renamed to "LGPL-2".
  * Changed compatibility symlink /usr/doc/copyright/LGPL so that it
    points to the old version.
  * Moved docs to /usr/share/doc/base-files.
  * Changed default /etc/motd so that it refers both to /usr/doc/*/copyright
    and /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Fri, 16 Jul 1999 19:45:09 +0200

base-files (2.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * preinst: Do not fiddle with /etc/issue.net anymore.
  * Changed the way /cdrom, /floppy and /initrd are handled.
    These directories will now be created by postinst in the initial install.
    This is a compromise after discussing in debian-policy about Bug #35928.
    It will save people who like them the work of creating them after
    installing a new system, and it will save people who dislike them the
    work of removing them every time base-files is upgraded.
    Since these directories are only a convenience for the user, who
    is free to use them or not, the spirit of FHS is preserved.
  * preinst and postinst: Following the principle of least surprise,
    added code so that existing directories are not removed when upgrading
    this package from previous releases.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue, 20 Apr 1999 15:39:36 +0200

base-files (2.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

base-files (2.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * debian_version, issue and issue.net: `slink' replaced by `2.1'.

base-files (2.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved common licenses to /usr/share/common-licenses.
  * Default dotfiles for root are now installed only the first time.
  * /usr/local and subdirectories are now created mode 2775
    and root.staff, according to policy.
  * Added /usr/local/share.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon, 26 Oct 1998 19:05:04 +0100

base-files (2.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * If it does not exist, now a default /root/.profile file is installed,
    not a /root/.bash_profile file, for slightly better POSIX compliance.

base-files (2.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

base-files (2.0) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Removed the "frozen" word from /etc/debian_version.
  * Removed the use of the ROOT variable in preinst and postinst for two
    reasons: a) It is no longer needed, since the base system is built
    by using dpkg's --root=dir option, which works in a chrooted environment;
    and b) Unexpected results would be obtained if user root had actually
    defined a variable named ROOT.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Sun, 24 May 1998 13:33:25 +0200

base-files (1.9) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Default prompt for root is now '\h:\w\$ '.
  * issue and issue.net: Removed the "frozen" word.
  * Added a README explaining the /usr/spool symlink removal.
  * nsswitch.conf: Use "compat" instead of "db files" for passwd, group
    and shadow (Bug #10896).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Sun, 26 Apr 1998 14:18:43 +0200

base-files (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

base-files (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "Depends: awk", so that awk is a "virtual essential package".
  * /root/.bash_profile and /root/.bashrc are not `conffiles' anymore.
    Instead, they are created from /root/.bash_profile.dpkg-dist and
    /root/.bashrc.dpkg-dist if they do not exist.
  * Default /root/.bash_profile sources /root/.bashrc.
  * PS1 and umask are now set only once in default /root/.bashrc.
  * Replaced /usr/bin/X11 by /usr/X11R6/bin in root's PATH.
  * Manpage hierarchy is no longer created under /usr/local/man.
  * Added a small comment in /etc/nsswitch.conf saying where
    to find documentation about this file (libc6-doc package).
  * Added some aliases for colorized `ls' commented out in .bashrc, so
    that the user will simply have to uncomment them.

    overwritten by /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh.
